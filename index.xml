                <p>This Intel software is considered Pre-Release Materials and is made available under a limited Evaluation License. The Pre-Release Materials may not be fully functional, and Intel may substantially modify the Pre-Release Materials in producing any “production” version. Intel can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a “final” or “production” version of the Pre-Release Materials. The Pre-Release Materials may not be modified or incorporated into any product; the Pre-Release Materials may not continue to be used if and once a commercial version is released; and the Pre-Released Materials, or any benchmarks, performance results, or other information relating to the Pre-Release Materials may not be disclosed to any third party.</p>

            <p>This guide will show you how to install and begin working with Intel®
            Time Coordinated Computing Tools (Intel® TCC Tools).</p>

                <p><b>Host-Target Environment</b></p>
                <p>The recommended environment for using Intel® TCC Tools consists of a host system for development tasks and a target system with supported hardware platform for application deployment and execution. You can also use a supported platform for both host and target tasks, but this is beyond the scope of this guide.</p>
                <p>You will walk through how to set up a host system and a target
                system. The host system is a Linux* machine. The target system is a reference implementation, consisting of a supported Intel hardware platform, reference BIOS, and Yocto Project*-based OS.
