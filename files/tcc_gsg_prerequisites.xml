                <p><b>Host System for Building Yocto Project*</b></p>
                <p>The recommended way of setting up the target OS is by creating a Yocto Project-based image using the platform board support package (BSP) and Intel® TCC Tools layer integrated into it. In addition, you may choose to add the Intel® VTune™ Profiler layer to your image to experience the full capabilities of Intel® VTune™ Profiler when profiling applications on your target system.</p>
                <p>This guide shows how to <xref scope="local" format="dita" href="tcc_gsg_build_yocto_image_toolchain.xml#build-yocto-image-toolchain" class="- topic/xref ">build the image</xref> for the target system. Building an image is time-consuming and requires substantial compute resources. You should ensure your host system is capable of doing it. The host system used for building the image can be different from the <xref scope="local" format="https" href="#gsg-prerequisites-host-dev" class="- topic/xref ">host system for development with Intel® TCC Tools</xref>. Consider using a dedicated server system to build the image and then share the image among developers.</p>
                <p>To build an image, you will need a host system that meets the following specifications:</p>
